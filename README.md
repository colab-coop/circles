# CoLab Circles

CoLab Circles is a map of the structure of the cooperative. Circles can have sub-Circles. Each Circle has aims, domains, and members. A template for Circles follows:

## AIMS:
(Write here about why this Circle exists. This is the reason for the Circle. All Circle members have authority within the Circle’s domain to further the AIM of this Circle.)

## DOMAIN:
(Write here about what authority the Circle has, exactly. This is what the Circle is responsible for. This should be defined clearly, with no overlap with other Circles, and without gaps.)

## MEMBERS:
(Write here about who is on this circle. And why. All members of a Circle should be there in service of the aim.)

### ROLES:
* DRI
  * (This person is the Directly Responsible Individual for the Circle; keeps forward momentum, and links / represents the parent Circle)
* FACILITATOR
  * (This person is the meeting planner; runs meetings)
* ADMINISTRATOR
  * (This person keeps notes, records, and interprets decisions)
* DELEGATE
  * (This person links / represents the Circle in the parent Circle)

## LINKAGES:
(Write here about how the Circle connects to its parent Circle. Double-linking is important for Circles with respect to information flow, psychological ownership and perspective, and representation.)

## MEETINGS:
(Write here about how often the Circle meets)

## BUDGET:
(Write here about how much this Circle will cost the parent Circle. The parent Circle approves the budget for sub-Circles.)

## TERM:
(Write here about how long this will take. This could be a "permanent" Circle, expected to last for years. Or it could be a "helper" Circle, given a specific task to complete in a few weeks. Include due dates. Reevaluation is FEEDBACK. We should try to follow: “good enough for now” paired with “safe enough to try”. We should bias toward action. We can generally agree to a proposal easier if we know it has an reevaluation / expiration date.)
