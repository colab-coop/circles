The DOMAIN of the General Circle is to "decide who decides". The General Circle will convene to review and discover the State of the Coop, and if there are needs raised by the members of the General Circle (all CoLab Members at any level), they will be heard and addressed and ideally immediately assigned to an Org Circle for implementation.

The General Circle consists of all Members of CoLab at any level.
