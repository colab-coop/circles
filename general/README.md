# Coordination Circle

## AIMS:
The AIMS of the Coordination Circle are the AIMS of CoLab. These AIMS are:

### Create self-governing cooperative workplace
### Create excellent technical solutions (for clients and ourselves)
### Work with clients who work for the common good

## DOMAIN:
The DOMAIN of the Coordination Circle is to "decide who decides". The Coordination Circle defines policies and plans to execute the AIMS of CoLab. The Coordination Circle will convene to review and discover the State of the Coop, and if there are needs (things that could be changed to better serve CoLab's AIMS) raised by the members of the Coordination Circle, they will be heard, addressed, and ideally, immediately assigned to an Org Circle for implementation.

## MEMBERS:
The Coordination Circle consists of all Members of CoLab at any level.
